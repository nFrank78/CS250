1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The best way to interpret user needs is by direct feedback and breaking that feedback down into individual functionalities or user stories. The user stories help by giving specific examples of what a user wants and analyzing how to develop that. User stories help to better understand the wants and needs of the user and then translate them into actualy functions that can be deveoped and implemented. 

2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

There are many methodologies on how to approach deveoping programs but the agile method is how I'd like to approach it because of how versatile and open it is. It allows for more easily made altercations during development, more collaboration and communication between team members, and more thorough testing of each individual function. I hope to implement Scrum into my future development work because it seems like a great work enviorment that would promote great work. 

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

There are many things that make a good team member in software development. A good work ethic is obviously a very important one that is neccessary to succeed in any work enviorment but communication and openness are also very important. Obeying the teams standards and providing input are important as well but being a good, positive, productive, comunicative team member is what makes one a great team member.
